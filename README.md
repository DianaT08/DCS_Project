# DCS Project
## Description
The aim of this project is developing a controller for two randomly assigned, real life intersections (the plant), including a closed-loop controller connected to the intersection's output channels and intersections.
The controller has a dynamic delay feature to extend the time of the green light in case of a traffic jam.
Besides the Java implementation, we created Petri Net models for the two assigned intersections, the middle road connecting them and the controller, a component diagram that showcases the relationship between these elements and we also ran two tests.
